Synopsis: This web app informs people who have recently gotten married, bought a house, or had a child about the tax implications
regarding their recent life events. This stems from a database established in MySQL that holds a table of information regarding a 
single person. This includes their name, address, homeowner status, marital status, and upcoming first child status. This would
take information from the database and generate an email with a php script and direct them to the specified link on our website
that relates to their situation. For example, a man who owns a home would get directed to our home owner tax implications site
whereas someone who recently had a child would get the tax implications of having a child webpage. Does not restrict to 
just having one status so you can get linked multiple videos. The website itself is written in HTML/CSS/Javascript and used
a template via Bootstrap. The links regarding the tax implifications contain information derived from the TurboTax website
and the internet as well as videos embedded into the HTML page from the TurboTax youtube page. Due to constrains on a lack
an e-mail server, the back end of our program wasn't able to be tested without paying for a server. 

Motivation: As a potetial opportunity to win the contest, the four of us wanted to gain experience in working as a team
and enriching our experience in working in hackathon-like activities. Whether we don't win the competition or get an interview,
we viewed the situation as a win-win to further enrich our knowledge and experience in the development world and the world
of working under time constrains, as well as how to plan and process our ideas. :)
